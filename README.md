Hi! This folder contains implementations of Finite State Machines (FSMs) using Verilog â€” crucial for modeling control logic in digital design. 
FSMs help you break complex sequential behavior into understandable and manageable states.

FSMs are used in:

  1) Communication protocols (UART, SPI, etc.)
  2) Sequence detectors
  3) Traffic light controllers
